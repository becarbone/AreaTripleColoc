# AreaTripleColoc
This macro is designed to determine if two sets of ROI colocalize, find the overlapped areas, and determine if those two colocalizations assocaite with a third ROI set. It then determines the area of overlap between the overlapped area of the first two and the third and prints out the average therein.
